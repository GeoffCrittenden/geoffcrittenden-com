Welcome to GeoffCrittenden.com!

This is my personal webpage/webapp. I graduated from DevBootcamp Chicago in October 2013, where I learned Agile development based on Ruby on Rails and JavaScript (as well as a LOT of other stuff). I am using this webapp to not only be my little corner of the web, but also to keep practicing my skills and expand into others. As I add technologies/features, they will be detailed below.

UPDATE: Nov. 4, 2013
  Installed Font Awesome 4.0.2 for icons and symbols.

UPDATE: Nov. 4, 2013
  Website is live on GitHub Pages.  Right now it is a static HTML page using some basic CSS.
