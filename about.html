        <p id="about"><img id="profile" src="profile_grey.jpg" title="It me!">Hello, I am a Chicago-based software engineer working primarily in Ruby on Rails applications.  After nearly a decade spent in military service as an aviator in the U.S. Navy, I decided to change course and made my way to software engineering.   It was the best professional decision I've ever made and haven't looked back since trading in a cockpit for a keyboard.</p>
        <p id="about">After attending an intensive web development course called Dev Bootcamp here in Chicago, I worked as an apprentice at a small software agency before moving to my current company, Enova, where I've been since 2014.</p>
        <p id="about">I am not currently seeking a change of employment, but am always open to networking and referral opportunities.  My strengths lie in backend/platform development with Ruby on Rails, but I also know some things about PostgreSQL, Linux (Debian, Ubuntu), APIs, Continuous Integration, Jenkins, monitoring, automation, incident management, deep dish pizza, burritos, Copper Age Marvel comic books, and fantasy football.</p>
        <p id="about">My family and I live in the Bridgeport area of Chicago, and we love it.  We hope to remain here for many years.  <!-- I also love taking photos, some of which I have up on this site.  Maybe some day I'll get good at it. --></p>
        <p id="thanks">Thanks,<br>Geoff</p>
